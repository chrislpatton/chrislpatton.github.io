            <p>So today marks the start of my fifth week at Hack Reactor and this is my first blog post... I know that I should have been blogging since day one or even before this but for me the journey in trying to keep up with the pace that Hack Reactor has set out for me since day one of my pre-course work is well, seems so ridiculously fast paced, that despite 10 to 14 hours a day trying to grasp the material, I always find myself somewhat lagging behind. </p>

<p>Since I have started my journey in coding, I have rewritten parts of the underscore library two times. I have learned about recursion, created a twitter clone and this was all before day 1. In the past four weeks, we have covered data structures, Inheritance Patterns in Javascript, we did a sprint on N-Queens,D3, jQuery and Ajax,learned about front-end MVC through Backbone, and this last week we learned about Node, Express, and databases mainly MySql and how to use Sequilize so that data is able to persist in our apps. </p>

<p>On top of all this in week two we were presented with new "Toy Problems" foundly called TP's Tuesday through Saturday every morning. These toy problems are anything but toys but amazing algorithms that test our ability to think algorithmically and solve problems, which usually have something to do with some kind of data structure but not always. These are tough but I am growing fonder of the every day as it shows that I am growing in my ability to break down a problem and the program it. </p>

<p>Lastly, every Monday starts off with a Self-Assessment which tests how well we digested the material from the last week and are able to apply it. I started off not doing so well on these but as the weeks have progressed I have found that the material is starting to click and the stress of taking these assessments is starting to subside some. I am hoping that this continues to be the case because at the end of week six there is an all day assessment which will/can decide whether I will be considered a graduate of Hack Reactor and can call myself a full-stack software engineer.  </p>

<p>Well, this probably is not the  best first blog post,but now that I have got it under my belt, I think that the rest will flow much smoother. So stay tuned...lol... because I will in the upcoming blog post start blogging about some of the things that I have learned here at Hack Reactor. Until then...  </p>
